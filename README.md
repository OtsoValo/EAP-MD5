# EAP-MD5
西安交通大学网络管理客户端

PS: This can also be achieved by [the EAP-MD5 client shipped with Windows 8.1](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/922574)

A better solution is to install [the official client](http://nic.xjtu.edu.cn/opensoft.asp?id=153) inside a virtual machine whose network adapter is bridged to the host and have the same MAC address as the adapter on the host computer. Log in on the guest machine then the host is connected to the Internet too. After that one may feel free to power off the guest machine.
